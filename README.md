### Description:

Machine learning can increase the value of renewable energy. 

Using historical data that is available between the years 1969-2017 for renewable production and consumption values: Can we make accurate predictions about how the values will change for each state?

### Questions:

* How renewable energy production will change in the US by state?
 
* Predict a state's ability to meet its Energy Consumption needs with Renewable Energy Production.

## Analysis

* Clean and modify the data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

* Use Heroku and PostgreSQL as the database.

* Use Python as the server side language, Flask as the web server and SQLAlchemy as the ORM.

* Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front end.

* Use D3, Plotly, Chart.js and Leaflet to visualize the data.
